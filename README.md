This project is a Steganography Tool implemented in C, designed to encode secret data into BMP images and decode the hidden data from stego images.The tool uses the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique to embed secret information (such as text files) into the pixel data of BMP images without visibly altering the image. It also supports decoding the hidden data from the stego image.
